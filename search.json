    "text": "Welcome to the IDEG workshop on Mediation Analysis and Directed Acyclic Graphs\nDuring this short workshop, you will be introduced to traditional mediation approaches before exploring the theory of causal mediation, as a method to investigate disease mechanisms in the context of diabetes.\nWe hope this will be the beginning of your journey in mediation analysis and open the door to more theory-grounded studies in aetiological diabetes epidemiology! The workshop is offered as part of the International Diabetes Epidemiology Group (IDEG) Trainee Workshop in Bangkok, Thailand, on 3 April 2025.\nThe workshop requires some pre-workshop preparation to install R and R Studio as well as some necessary packages and data. Furthermore, for those unfamiliar with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), some introductory reading and exercises are included in the pre-workshop materials.\nThe face-to-face workshop will consist of a combination of brief lectures and hands-on coding practice in R code-along sessions. We encourage students to discuss the materials and network during the entire Trainee Workshop. The instructors will be available to answer questions throughout the day.\nüóì April 3, 2025 üè® Bangkok, Thailand",

In the case of etiological epidemiology, we are interested in assessing the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Before embarking on statistical analyses DAGs can help us map our prior knowledge and assumptions about the various mechanisms that influence or explain the causal effect we are interested in. DAGs can help to guide us in the design of our study, the choice of which data to collect, and in how to set up our statistical analysis to adequately control for known sources of bias and confounding.\nIn preparation for our workshop on mediation analysis, it is important that you understand the basic concepts and notations used when drawing and communicating about our causal assumptions using DAGs.",

If we were to study the causal effect of BMI on T2D only in people who have a history of MI, we would be conditioning on a collider.

Using these variables, construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to illustrate potential causal relationships and identify possible confounders, mediators and colliders. You may also consider using U to represent unknown factors.\nCompare and discuss your DAG with your peers to identify similarities, differences, and potential improvements.\nHow would the DAG change if you are just starting to plan a study?\nDuring the study planning phase, the structure of the DAG might evolve based on additional considerations. For example:\nIdentifying further potential confounders: These are variables that may affect both the exposure (physical activity) and the outcome (Type 2 diabetes), and should therefore be measured and adjusted for. Potential confounders could include factors such as diet, neighborhood environment, income, and genetic predisposition.\nIdentifying furhter potential colliders: These are variables that are dependent on both the exposure (physical activity) and the outcome (Type 2 diabetes). We should avoid selecting (stratifying) or otherwise conditioning on colliders. Can you think of 1 or 2 additional potential colliders?",

    "text": "4.1 Mediation analysis in Epidemiology\nIn clinical and epidemiological research, the primary focus is often on determining whether a specific exposure or intervention has an effect on a disease or health outcome (aetiological epidemiology). Once this effect is established, the next natural question is to explore the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù‚Äîthe underlying mechanisms that explain how the exposure (or intervention) leads to the observed outcome. As we are not only interested in whether an exposure/intervention has an effect, but in how this effect works (1).\nMediation analysis helps us to define an answer to this HOW question, by quantitatively exploring the pathways and mechanisms that explain the causal relationship between the exposure (or intervention or treatment) and the outcome. By doing so, mediation analysis helps to open the black box.",

These studies randomized high diabetes risk individuals to either a lifestyle intervention (consisting of diet modfication in combination with physical activity) or routine health advice and care. The main finding was a ~58% lower risk of incidence type 2 diabetes in the lifestyle intervention group compared to the routine care group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might be interested in further refining the intervention so as to increase the magnitude of the effect. It would be interesting to know if the lifestyle changes reduce the risk of diabetes only because they lower BMI (effect mediated through BMI) or if lifestyle has a direct impact on diabetes risk that does not require any change in BMI. This may help us understand how important BMI targets are in future lifestyle modification programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you find a relevant mediation question in your own research?\n\n\n\nSpend 3 minutes talking to your neighbour and discuss an mediation question that may be relevant in your own research.",

    "text": "4.3 Motivations for running this workshop\nThe methodological framework for conducting mediation analysis has evolved rapidly in recent years, making it a crucial tool for understanding complex relationships in research. Initially rooted in basic regression techniques, mediation analysis has advanced into causal mediation analysis, enabling researchers to unravel the intricate pathways between exposures, mediators, and outcomes.\nThis short workshop aims to introduce the basic statistical framework, key assumptions, and practical applications of both traditional and modern mediation analysis techniques. Through real-world data examples, we‚Äôll explore how mediation analysis can enhance your research and understanding of causal relationships.\nDespite its growing importance, mediation analysis is often used incorrectly. A recent systematic review on the reporting quality of studies applying mediation analysis revealed that many studies provide incomplete reporting, which hinders both reproducibility and the translation of findings into practice (5) .\nOur goal is for you to learn how to apply mediation analysis correctly and leverage it as a powerful tool to advance your research. By improving the quality and rigor of mediation analysis in your work, you can ensure more reliable findings and meaningful insights.",

The predominant hypothesis is that physical activity contributes to weight reduction, which in turn improves cardiovascular function and lowers resting pulse rate. Therefore, we aim to investigate the extent to which the effect of physical activity on resting pulse rate is mediated by BMI.\nThe situation is depicted by below figure.\nHow much does BMI explain the relation between physical activity and pulse rate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Dataset: A Brief Overview\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll explore the relationship between physical activity and pulse in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, which has been modified for this workshop with simulated variables.\nTo try this out in practice, we load the NHANES dataset, only keep the variables we need for the example.\nThe variables used in the dataset:\n\nexposure of interest (a): physical activity (continuous variable)\noutcome (y): Pulse (continuous variable)\nmediator (m): BMI (continuous variable)\n\nNote that the example is created to demonstrate the methods, and there is no clinical relevance of the results. For the convenience of analysis, we have transformed the mediator (m) and outcome variable (y) so that they follow a normal distribution.\nFour demographic variables are considered in the analysis: age, gender, education, and smoking.

And the rational of this approach is to compare the effect of A on Y without and with adding M in the models.\nIf a mediation effect exists, the effect of A on Y will be attenuated when M is included in the regression, indicating the effect of A on Y goes through M. If the effect of A on Y completely disappears, M fully mediates between A and Y (full mediation). If the effect of A on Y still exists, but in a smaller magnitude, M partially mediates between A and Y (partial mediation).\nBack to the example, the indirect effect will be the coefficient of physical activity in model c (without adjusting for m) minus the coefficient of physical activity in model b (adjusting for m), which equals to -0.34.\n\nindirect_mb &lt;- fitc$coefficients[2] - fitb$coefficients[2]\nindirect_mb\n\n     aYes \n-0.335054 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe algebraic equivalence of the indirect effect using the product method and the difference method will coincide for a continuous outcome on the difference scale (MacKinnon 1995). However, the two methods diverge when using a binary outcome and logistic regression. (MacKinnon and Dwyer 1993).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRecall the four criteria suggested by Baron and Kenny. One of the criteria is that ‚ÄòPath C must be significantly different from 0 to ensure there is a total effect between A and Y‚Äô. However, this step can be controversial. Even if we don‚Äôt find a significant association between A and Y, we could proceed to the next step if we have a strong theoretical basis for their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup work - 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss with your group about the two traditional approaches, did you get the same results?\nDiscuss the scenarios under which there might be no significant association between A and Y.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Use mediation packages\nNow we have estimated the direct and indirect effect using the product and the difference methods.You might have noticed what you got so far are only point estimates, but what if you want to see if this mediation effect is statistically significant (different from zero or not)?\nTo do so, there are two main approaches: the Sobel test (2) and bootstrapping (3).\nHere we will demonstrate that we can use the mediate() function in ‚Äòmediation‚Äô package (4) to conduct mediation analysis. One of the advantages of conducting mediation analysis using the mediation package is we can get confidence intervals by bootstrapping.\nLet‚Äôs load up the R packages.\n\nlibrary(mediation) # Mediation package\n\nLoading required package: MASS\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\n\nLoading required package: Matrix\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Matrix'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    expand, pack, unpack\n\n\nLoading required package: mvtnorm\n\n\nLoading required package: sandwich\n\n\nmediation: Causal Mediation Analysis\nVersion: 4.5.0\n\n\nmediate() takes two model objects as input (\\(A \\rightarrow M\\) and \\(A + M \\rightarrow Y\\)) and we need to specify which variable is the exposure (A) [treatment] and the mediator (M) [mediator].

It describes the direct effect of the exposure (A) on the outcome (Y) when controlling for the mediator (M). Note this estimate is the same as the coefficient we got in the product and difference method.\nACME is the Average Causal Mediation Effect. This is the indirect effect of the exposure (A) on the outcome (Y) that goes through the mediator (M). Note that ACME estimated to be -0.335, which is the same as the traditional approached we just used. By bootstrapping we are now able to get a confidence interval and significance level for the indirect effect, not only its two individual parts. This is something we will need when we report our mediation analysis.\nTotal Effect is the Total Effect (direct + indirect) of the exposure (A) on the outcome (Y). We can also get it by adding the ACME (-0.335) and the ADE (-1.423).\nProp. Mediated is the proportion of the effect of the exposure (A) on the outcome (Y) that is mediated through the mediator (M). It is calculated by dividing the ACME (-0.335) by the total effect (-1.758) and yields 0.191. This result suggests that the mediator (BMI) explains 19% of the effect of physical activity on pulse rate.\n\n\n# We can also plot the estimates\nplot(results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor details of the mediate() package, please refer to (4).",

Or in another scenario, you anticipate that performing action A will result in outcome Y. In some instances, we can identify deterministic relationships where action A will lead to outcome Y. While these straightforward cause-and-effect relationships are intuitive and help us navigate the world, they become significantly more complex when we explore health outcomes.\n\n6.1.1 Individual causal effect\nWhen investigating health outcomes, we would ideally want to know if you do X, then Y will happen. We could have a specific question:\n\nWill take the magic pill reduce my risk of developing T2D in 5 years?\n\nTo answer this question we would ideally have you take the magic pill over 5 years and diagnose whether you get T2D. Then, we would turn back time, and make you do not take the pill and then diagnose T2D. If there is a difference between your two outcomes, then we say there is a causal effect.\nBut we can never do this in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nA = received treatment/intervention/exposure (e.g., 1 = intervention, 0 = no intervention)\nY = observed outcome (e.g., 1 = developed the outcome, 0 = no outcome)\n\\(Y^{a=1}\\) = Counterfactual outcome under treatment a=1 (i.e., the outcome had everyone, counter to the fact, received treatment a = 1)\n\\(Y^{a=0}\\) = Counterfactual outcome under treatment a =0 (i.e., the outcome had everyone, counter to the fact, received treatment a = 0)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Average causal effect\nInstead, we can perform a randomized controlled trial. We now ask a slightly different question:\n\nWill taking the magic pill reduce the risk of T2D?\n\nWe can randomly assigning one group to take the pill, and the other group not to take the pill over 5 years. Then we compare the average risk of T2D after 5 year in each of the groups. If there is a difference, we could say there is an average causal effect (1).\nMore formally we can now define a causal effect:\n\\(E[Y^{a=1} = 1]-E[Y^{a=0} = 1]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nWe now modify the terms a little.\n\\(E[Y^{a=1}]\\) the average counterfactual outcome, had all subjects in the population received treatment a = 1.\n\\(Pr[Y^{a=1}]\\) the proportion of subjects that would have developed the outcome Y had all subjects in the population of interest received treatment a = 1.\n\\(E[Y^{a=0}]\\) the average counterfactual outcome, had all subjects in the population received no treatment a = 0.\n\\(Pr[Y^{a=0}]\\) the proportion of subjects that would have developed the outcome Y had all subjects in the population of interest received no treatment a = 0.",

The effect should be the same as the one you would have observed had the groups been correct.\nWe can also have conditional exchangeability. The risk is similar in subsets of the population. That could be within the levels of a variable W (e.g., education).\n\nConsistency\n\nThe treatments under comparison are well-defined and correspond to the versions of treatment observed in the data:\n\nPrecise definition of \\(Y^a\\) via a\nLink counterfactual outcomes with observed outcomes\n\n\\(Y^a = Y\\) for every individual with A = a.\nThe observed outcome for all treated equals the outcome if they had received the treatment (the potential outcome).\n\nPositivity\n\nThe probability of receiving every value of treatment conditional on L is greater than zero. In other words, there must be a probability of being assigned to each treatment level.\nImage if we don‚Äôt have anyone with A = 0 among those with L=1 (e.g. long education), then we cannot estimate the conditional probability of the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2 Confounding assumptions in Causal Mediation Analysis\nConfounding assumptions are critical for valid causal inferences in mediation analysis. These assumptions specify the conditions under which we can interpret our estimates as truly causal rather than merely associational.\n\n\nno unmeasured exposure-outcome confounding\nno unmeasured exposure-mediator confounding\nno unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding\nmediator-outcome confounding not affected by the exposure/treatment (post-treatment confounder or intermediate confounder)\n\n\nBy using DAGs, the assumptions about confounding are made much more explicit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that we not only have to take confounding between the exposure and outcome into account, but we also have to take mediator-outcome (\\(A \\leftarrow W \\rightarrow Y\\)) confounding into account.\nIn addition, we can have a more complicated situation where the exposure also impacts another mediator that is also a mediator-outcome confounder.\nBelow DAG shows where the mediator-outcome relation is affected by treatment(or exposure):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the DAG rules, we have a special problem that we cannot solve with traditional regression approaches.

Here we see a little lower pulse rate, this means we‚Äôre measuring the direct effect of physical activity on pulse rate while allowing BMI to be at the level it would naturally be with physical activity (a=1).\nThe TNDE asks the question: ‚Äúto what extent does physical activity cause lower pulse via pathways other than through BMI, allowing BMI to boost up or tune down such effect at the same time?‚Äù (5)\n\n\n6.8.4 Total natural indirect effect\nThe TNIE can be obtained by this formula:\n\\(TNIE = (\\sigma_2 * \\beta_1 + \\sigma_3 * \\beta_1 * a)(a - a^*)\\)\n\nTNIE &lt;- ((lm_y$coefficients[3] * lm_m$coefficients[2]) + (lm_y$coefficients[5] * lm_m$coefficients[2] * 1)) * (1 - 0)\nround(as.numeric(TNIE), digits = 2)\n\n[1] -0.51\n\n\nThe TNIE is how much the outcome would change on average if the exposure was fixed at level a = 1 but the mediator was changed from the level it would take if a* = 0 (physical inactive) to the level it would take if a =1 (physical active).\nNote that exposure has to have an effect on M otherwise this will be zero.\nThe TNIE asks the question: to what extent does physical activity cause pulse via BMI and the possible interaction between physical activity and BMI in affecting pulse rate? In other words, the effect of exposure that ‚Äòwould be prevented if the exposure did not cause the mediator‚Äô (i.e., the portion of the effect for which mediation is ‚Äònecessary‚Äô) (5).\nThis is often the effect we are interested in in biomedical research for questions regarding mediation.\n\n\n6.8.5 Pure natural indirect effect\nThe PNIE can be obtained by this formula:\n\\(PNIE = (\\sigma_2 * \\beta_1 + \\sigma_3 * \\beta_1 * a^*)(a - a^*)\\)\n\nPNIE &lt;- ((lm_y$coefficients[3] * lm_m$coefficients[2]) + (lm_y$coefficients[5] * lm_m$coefficients[2] * 0)) * (1 - 0)\nround(as.numeric(PNIE), digits = 2)\n\n[1] -0.27\n\n\nThe PNIE is different from the TNIE because it does not include the interaction effect. We estimate the effect of physical activity on BMI and then subsequent effect of BMI on pulse rate.\nThe PNIE answer the question: ‚Äúto what extent does physical activity cause lower pulse rate via BMI only (i.e., due to physical activity affecting BMI and subsequently, BMI affecting pulse rate), not accounting for the possible interaction between physical activity and BMI? In other words, the effect that the exposure would have had if ‚Äòits only action were to cause the mediator‚Äô (i.e., the portion of the effect for which mediation is ‚Äò‚Äôsufficient‚Äô‚Äô)‚Äù (5).\n\n\n6.8.6 Total effect\nThe total effect can be decomposed as:\n\\(TE = PNDE + TNIE\\)\n\nTE &lt;- PNDE + TNIE\nround(as.numeric(TE), digits = 2)\n\n[1] -2.39\n\n\nThis is the overall effect of physical activity on pulse rate.\n\n\n6.8.7 Proportion mediation\nFrom this, we can calculate the proportion mediated.\n\\(PM = \\frac{TNIE}{TE}\\)\n\nPM &lt;- TNIE / TE\nas.numeric(PM) * 100\n\n[1] 21.18849\n\n\n21% of the association between physical activity and pulse rate is mediated by the mediator BMI.",
